# Phase 4: Message Handlers

Message processing logic for worker completion/error messages. All handlers include sender validation and state guards to prevent duplicate processing.

## Message Processing Rules

Messages from workers arrive as conversation context in each heartbeat iteration. Match against ON handlers below. If no match → ON NO NEW MESSAGES (see phase4_heartbeat.md).

### SENDER VALIDATION

Before processing ANY completion message, verify sender:
```
VERIFY message.sender == worker_map[id]
IF mismatch: LOG "Ignoring stale message from {sender} for {id}"; SKIP handler
```
This prevents old/dead workers from corrupting pipeline state.

### STATE GUARD

Before processing ANY stage completion, verify story is in expected state:
- Stage 0 COMPLETE → story_state[id] must be "STAGE_0"
- Stage 1 COMPLETE → story_state[id] must be "STAGE_1"
- Stage 2 COMPLETE → story_state[id] must be "STAGE_2"
- Stage 3 COMPLETE → story_state[id] must be "STAGE_3"

```
IF mismatch:
  # Duplicate — re-send ACK (worker may be retrying), do NOT reprocess
  SendMessage(recipient: worker_map[id],
    content: "ACK Stage {N} for {id}", summary: "{id} ACK (dup)")
  LOG "Duplicate/stale message for {id} (state={story_state[id]})"; SKIP handler
```
This prevents double-spawn when same completion message is delivered across heartbeats. Re-sending ACK ensures retrying workers get confirmation.

## Stage 0 Handlers (Task Planning)

## Crash Detection Handler

### ON worker TeammateIdle WITHOUT prior completion message for {id}

3-step crash detection protocol (see worker_health_contract.md):

```
# Step 1: Flag suspicious
suspicious_idle = true

# Step 2: Probe
SendMessage(recipient: worker_map[id],
            content: "Status check: are you still working on Stage {N} for {id}?",
            summary: "{id} health check")

# Step 3: Evaluate
ON worker responds with parseable status:
  suspicious_idle = false                # False alarm, continue

ON TeammateIdle again WITHOUT response:
  crash_count[id]++
  IF crash_count[id] <= 1:
    # Resume protocol (see checkpoint_format.md):
    checkpoint = read(".pipeline/checkpoint-{id}.json")
    IF checkpoint.agentId exists:
      Task(resume: checkpoint.agentId)          # Try 1: full context resume
      # worker_map[id] remains unchanged (same agent, resumed)
    ELSE:
      next_worker = "story-{id}-s{checkpoint.stage}-retry"
      new_prompt = worker_prompt(story, checkpoint.stage, business_answers) + CHECKPOINT_RESUME block
      Task(name: next_worker, team_name: "pipeline-{date}",
           model: "opus", mode: "bypassPermissions", subagent_type: "general-purpose",
           prompt: new_prompt)                  # Try 2: Opus for crash recovery/troubleshooting
      worker_map[id] = next_worker
  ELSE:
