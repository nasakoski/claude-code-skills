# Exit code 2 = "don't stop" (Claude Code hooks protocol).
# This hook IS the heartbeat driver: each exit 2 creates a new agentic loop iteration
# where queued worker messages get delivered and processed by ON handlers in Phase 4.
# Lead writes .pipeline/state.json with complete=false during pipeline execution.
# Phase 5 sets complete=true before cleanup, allowing graceful stop.
