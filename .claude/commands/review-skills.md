# Skill Coherence Review

You review changed skills with automated bash checks (Phase 2), 9 structural dimensions (D1-D9), and 5 intent checks (M1-M5). Fix issues in-place. Report with PASS/FAIL verdict.

## Phase 1: Scope Detection

**If `$ARGUMENTS` provided:** treat each token as a skill directory prefix (e.g., `ln-400` matches `ln-400-story-executor/`). Glob `{prefix}*/SKILL.md` per token.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` empty:** auto-detect from git:
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
git diff --name-only --cached
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```
Extract unique skill dirs (pattern `ln-\d+-[^/]+`) and shared paths (`shared/`). If shared files changed, Grep all `ln-*/SKILL.md` for references to changed filenames.

**Build scope:**
1. **Primary** — skills with directly changed files
2. **Affected** — skills referencing changed shared files
3. **Dependencies** — for each primary skill, extract `ln-\d{3,4}` references from its SKILL.md (callers, callees, worker tables)

Deduplicate. Report: `Scope: N primary, M affected, K dependency skills.`

## Phase 2: Automated Verification

Run these bash commands for every SKILL.md in scope. Record failures — they feed D7/D8 as pre-verified violations. Every FAIL is a confirmed violation — no judgment needed, no skipping allowed.

**Frontmatter check** (D7):
```bash
for f in {scoped SKILL.md files}; do
  head -5 "$f" | grep -q "^---" || echo "FAIL: no frontmatter: $f"
  grep -q "^name:" "$f" || echo "FAIL: no name: $f"
  grep -q "^description:" "$f" || echo "FAIL: no description: $f"
done
```

**Version/date check** (D7):
```bash
for f in {scoped SKILL.md files}; do
  grep -q "\*\*Version:\*\*" "$f" || echo "FAIL: no version: $f"
  grep -q "\*\*Last Updated:\*\*" "$f" || echo "FAIL: no date: $f"
  grep -q "\*\*Changes:\*\*" "$f" && echo "FAIL: has Changes section: $f"
done
```

**Size check** (D8):
```bash
for f in {scoped SKILL.md files}; do
  lines=$(wc -l < "$f")
  [ "$lines" -gt 800 ] && echo "FAIL: $lines lines (>800): $f"
done
```

**Description length check** (D8):
```bash
for f in {scoped SKILL.md files}; do
  desc=$(sed -n '/^description:/p' "$f" | sed 's/^description: *//' | tr -d '"')
  len=${#desc}
  [ "$len" -gt 200 ] && echo "FAIL: description $len chars (>200): $f"
done
```

**MANDATORY READ path verification** (D2):
```bash
for f in {scoped SKILL.md files}; do
  dir=$(dirname "$f")
  grep "MANDATORY READ" "$f" | tr '`' '\n' | grep -E '\.(md|json|txt|yaml|sh)$' | grep -v '{' | sort -u | while read path; do
    [ -f "$dir/$path" ] || [ -f "$path" ] || echo "FAIL: missing MANDATORY READ target: $path (from $f)"
  done
done
```

**Orphan references check** (D7):
```bash
for f in {scoped SKILL.md files}; do
  dir=$(dirname "$f")
  if [ -d "$dir/references" ]; then
    find "$dir/references" -type f | while read ref; do
      base=$(basename "$ref")
      [[ "$base" == .* ]] && continue
      grep -q "$base" "$f" || echo "FAIL: orphan reference: $ref (not in $f)"
    done
  fi
done
```

**Passive file reference check** (D2):
```bash
for f in {scoped SKILL.md files}; do
  grep -nE '(^See |^Per |^Follows |See \[).*\.(md|txt|yaml)' "$f" | grep -v "MANDATORY READ" && echo "WARN: passive file ref in $f"
done
```

**Marketplace skill path check** (D8):
```bash
grep -oE '"\.\/ln-[^"]+' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | tr -d '"' | while read path; do
  [ ! -d "$path" ] && echo "FAIL: marketplace.json references missing dir: $path"
done
```

**Root docs stale skill name check** (D6):
```bash
for doc in README.md AGENTS.md .claude-plugin/marketplace.json; do
  [ -f "$doc" ] || continue
  grep -oE 'ln-[0-9]+-[a-z-]+' "$doc" | sort -u | while read skill; do
    ls -d ${skill}*/ >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "FAIL: $doc references missing skill: $skill"
  done
done
```

**Skill count accuracy check** (D8):
```bash
actual=$(ls -d ln-*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
badge=$(grep -oE 'skills-[0-9]+' README.md | grep -oE '[0-9]+')
[ "$badge" != "$actual" ] && echo "FAIL: README badge says $badge, actual $actual"
market=$(grep -oE '"\.\/ln-[^"]+' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | wc -l)
[ "$market" != "$actual" ] && echo "FAIL: marketplace.json has $market entries, actual $actual"
```

## Phase 3: Nine-Dimension Review

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `docs/SKILL_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` (Skill Directory Structure, Red Flags tables, SRP Decision Tree, all Checklists).

Read every SKILL.md in scope. Check ALL dimensions across ALL skills in scope. Phase 2 failures are pre-verified — include them directly, do not re-check.

### D1: Flow Integrity
- Every `ln-NNN` reference in workflow/worker tables points to an existing `ln-NNN-*/SKILL.md`
- No circular delegation loops (A → B → A)
- Every worker invocation has a matching caller reference in the target skill
- No dead-end flows (delegation to a worker with no output/return path)
- Peer coordinators (L2 siblings under same L1) do not reference each other — cross-group coordination is L1's job
- Peer workers (L3 siblings under same L2) do not reference each other — each worker knows only its coordinator

### D2: Cross-Reference Consistency
- `MANDATORY READ` paths exist on disk (Glob each path)
- `Reference Files` section paths exist on disk
- Caller/callee references are bidirectional: if A lists B as worker, B mentions A as caller
- Skill invocation names (`skill: "ln-NNN-*"`) match actual directory names
- No passive file references (`See`, `Per`, `Follows` pointing to files) — must be `**MANDATORY READ:** Load`
- Multiple `**MANDATORY READ:**` in same section → group into ONE block at section start
- `> **Paths:**` note present after frontmatter if SKILL.md contains any file references

### D3: Duplication
- Same instructions/rules not repeated across multiple skills
- Shared logic lives in `shared/references/`, skill-specific in SKILL.md (SRP)
- No copy-pasted blocks that should be a MANDATORY READ to a shared file

### D4: Contradiction Detection
- Thresholds (confidence, impact, scores) consistent across related skills
- Status transitions consistent (who sets which status)
- Rules about the same concept do not conflict between caller and callee
- Verdict names and categories match across prompt templates, workflows, SKILL.md files

### D5: Context Economy
- No large inline blocks that could be conditional MANDATORY READs
- Metadata in table format where possible
- No verbose explanations where a table/list suffices
- No filler words: "simply", "quickly", "easily", "on top of that", "in many cases"
- Passive voice where active is clearer ("File should be loaded" → "Load file")
- Sentences over 25 words — flag for splitting
- Verbose phrases not applied from `shared/concise_terms.md` ("in order to" → "to", "make sure that" → "ensure")
- Every content block must enable a specific agent action or decision — remove if agent behavior unchanged without it
- Tables must add information beyond adjacent text, templates, or formulas — no restating
- 1:1 mapping tables (each row = one input → one output, no conditions) → convert to inline list
- Tables echoing template section names/structure → reference the template, don't duplicate
- **Tiebreaker re-read:** After micro-checks above, re-read each changed section end-to-end. If same instruction can be expressed in fewer words without losing agent actionability — compress. Apply code_efficiency_criterion tiebreaker to skill text: among equivalent formulations, choose shorter

### D6: Stale Artifacts
- No references to removed/renamed skills or files
- No outdated caller names (skill renamed but old name in callers)
- No instructions about features that no longer exist
- No placeholder/TODO markers left from previous edits

### D7: Structural Compliance
- YAML frontmatter has `name` and `description` fields
- If `description` contains `:`, it is wrapped in double quotes (prevents YAML parse break)
- `**Version:** X.Y.Z` and `**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD` present at end of file
- No `**Changes:**` section exists (git history tracks changes, not inline changelog)
- Files in `references/` are actually referenced from SKILL.md (no orphan reference files)

### D8: Architecture Conformance
- SKILL.md ≤ 800 lines total (SRP threshold per SKILL_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE)
- Frontmatter `description` ≤ 200 chars
- Phase/step numbering is sequential (1, 2, 3, 4 — no gaps). Exception: 4a/4b for CREATE/REPLAN
- Orchestrators (L1/L2) delegate work, not execute directly — no detailed implementation logic in their SKILL.md
- Workers (L3) execute, not decide workflow — no routing/priority logic in their SKILL.md
- L2→L2 cross-category delegation follows forward-flow (0XX→1XX→…→6XX), except 0XX shared services
- Coupling reduction in `shared/` files — shared references describe patterns, NOT consumers. Forbidden in any form: `Used by`, `Skills using this:`, `For ln-NNN`, `via ln-NNN` suffixes, skill names in role descriptions, skill IDs in code examples. Use generic role names (`task executor`, `review worker`). Consumers reference shared via MANDATORY READ; reverse direction is never needed

### D9: Pattern Compliance (conditional — `ln-6*` audit skills only)
- References `shared/references/two_layer_detection.md` via MANDATORY READ (Layer 1: grep, Layer 2: context)
- Scoring formula consistent: `penalty = (C×2.0) + (H×1.0) + (M×0.5) + (L×0.2)`
- Report structure follows `shared/templates/audit_worker_report_template.md`

## Phase 4: Intent Review

Evaluate DESIGN INTENT of changes. Applies to primary skills only (affected/dependency skills have no changed intent to review).

For each primary skill, read the git diff (`git diff HEAD -- {skill_dir}/`).

### M1: Goal Clarity
- REAL GOAL evident from diff + commit message alone (apply `shared/references/goal_articulation_gate.md`)
- NOT THE GOAL identified — surface-level reading would NOT produce the same answer as REAL GOAL
- Goal unclear from diff alone → `UNCLEAR_GOAL` (RETHINK); warn that Phase 4 fixes may address wrong intent

### M2: Approach Optimality (scope: NEW changes only)
- New abstractions count ≤3 (phases, reference files, shared patterns)
- No Red Flags triggered from SKILL_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE table
- KISS/YAGNI criteria pass per `shared/references/creation_quality_checklist.md` (#11, #12)
- No simpler approach achieves the same goal with fewer lines/phases/files
- Simpler alternative exists → finding with specific description (SIMPLIFY or RETHINK)

### M3: Ecosystem Consistency
- 2-3 peer skills in same category (same NXX prefix) use consistent delegation pattern, hierarchy level, workflow pattern
- No existing `shared/references/` file that changed skill should reuse but doesn't
- Divergence from peers has documented rationale
- Missed shared/ reuse → finding with specific file path (SIMPLIFY)

### M4: Rewrite Delta (scope: WHOLE skill-as-changed)
- SRP Decision Tree applied to skill-as-changed (not just the diff)
- Tree does NOT suggest different structure (split/combine/re-level)
- If delta HIGH (>30% different from clean-slate design) → 1-3 sentence structural recommendation (RETHINK)

### M5: Necessity (YAGNI Classification)

Classify each diff hunk against M1's REAL GOAL:

| Label | Definition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| REQUESTED | Directly implements REAL GOAL | KEEP |
| DERIVED | Necessary side-effect of REAL GOAL | KEEP |
| SPECULATIVE | Not requested, model-generated addition | ASK user |

**SPECULATIVE detection signals:**
- Content keywords: `future-proof`, `might need`, `prepare for`, `extensible`, `scalable for`, `in case`, `optional`, `configurable`, `placeholder`, `eventually`
- Structural: new files/phases/sections absent from request; error handling outside stated scope; config with single consumer; abstractions with single implementation; fallback paths for non-existent conditions

**Additional checks (all hunks):**
- No backward-compat shims or unused artifacts per `shared/references/clean_code_checklist.md`
- Research-to-Action Gate: change inspired by external research — what specific defect does it fix? No defect → REVERT

**Output** — build classification table:

| # | File:Lines | Label | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|

**Speculative Change Gate:** if SPECULATIVE items exist, present ALL via single AskUserQuestion:
```
M5 found {N} speculative additions not traced to REAL GOAL:
1. {file:lines} — {rationale}
2. {file:lines} — {rationale}
Reply KEEP or REVERT per item (e.g., '1:KEEP 2:REVERT'). Default: REVERT all.
```
User KEEP → reclassify as REQUESTED. Remaining SPECULATIVE → REVERT finding for Phase 5.

**Finding categories:**
- **SIMPLIFY** — concrete reduction possible, may be auto-fixed
- **RETHINK** — design decision needed, NOT auto-fixable, advisory only
- **REVERT** — change does not fix a concrete defect, must be rolled back

## Phase 5: Fix

For each finding:
- **Fixable** (wrong path, stale ref, missing bidirectional ref, duplicated content) — fix immediately via Edit
- **Ambiguous** (conflicting thresholds where correct value unclear) — list in report, do NOT guess
- **SIMPLIFY** (from Phase 4) with unambiguous action — fix immediately
- **REVERT** (from Phase 4) — roll back the change via Edit (restore original content from git)
- **RETHINK** (from Phase 4) — do NOT fix, pass to Phase 6 report

## Phase 6: Report

**Verdict rules:**
- Any D1-D9 violation NOT auto-fixed → **FAIL**
- Only RETHINK findings (no unfixed violations) → **PASS with CONCERNS**
- Zero findings → **PASS**

```
## Skill Coherence Review — {PASS|PASS with CONCERNS|FAIL}

**Scope:** {list of reviewed skills}
**Verdict:** {PASS|PASS with CONCERNS|FAIL}

### Automated Checks (Phase 2)
| Check | Result | Failures |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Frontmatter (D7) | {PASS/FAIL} | {list or —} |
| Version/Date (D7) | {PASS/FAIL} | {list or —} |
| Size ≤800 (D8) | {PASS/FAIL} | {list or —} |
| Description ≤200 (D8) | {PASS/FAIL} | {list or —} |
| MANDATORY READ paths (D2) | {PASS/FAIL} | {list or —} |
| Orphan references (D7) | {PASS/FAIL} | {list or —} |
| Passive file refs (D2) | {PASS/FAIL} | {list or —} |
| Marketplace paths (D8) | {PASS/FAIL} | {list or —} |
| Root docs stale names (D6) | {PASS/FAIL} | {list or —} |
| Skill count accuracy (D8) | {PASS/FAIL} | {list or —} |

### Fixed ({count})
| # | Skill | Dim | Issue | Fix Applied |
|---|-------|-----|-------|-------------|

### Intent Findings ({count})
**M5 Classification:** {R} requested, {D} derived, {S} speculative ({K} kept, {V} reverted)

| # | Skill | Dim | Finding | Category |
|---|-------|-----|---------|----------|

Categories: RETHINK (design decision needed), SIMPLIFY (concrete reduction — auto-fixed above or listed here)

### Remaining Concerns ({count})
| # | Skill | Dim | Issue | Why Not Auto-Fixed |
|---|-------|-----|-------|--------------------|

### Clean
Dimensions with no findings: {list}
```

If zero findings: `All 9 structural dimensions + 5 intent checks clean. PASS.`

## Phase 7: CHANGELOG Update

After Phase 6 report, update `CHANGELOG.md` if any fixes were applied or structural changes made:

1. Check if today's date already has an entry in CHANGELOG.md
2. If yes — append to existing paragraph
3. If no — add new `## YYYY-MM-DD` entry (newest first) with ONE concise paragraph (3-5 sentences)
4. Summarize what was fixed/changed in this review run
5. Do NOT include "Total skills: N" counts — these change too frequently

## Phase 8: Volatile Numbers Cleanup

Skill/plugin/category counts go stale after every add/remove. One rule: **counts ONLY in README.md badge** (`skills-NNN`). Everywhere else — no hardcoded counts.

**Remove from any file** (including marketplace.json descriptions, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, CHANGELOG.md, SKILL.md):
- Total skill counts, per-plugin counts, per-category counts
- Worker/coordinator counts referencing OTHER skills (a skill's OWN internals are fine)

Phase 2 automated check verifies README badge matches actual skill count on disk — fix if FAIL.

## Rules
- Automated checks (Phase 2) are NON-NEGOTIABLE — every FAIL must appear in the report
- Do NOT skip any dimension for any skill in scope — check ALL D1-D9 for ALL skills
- If unsure whether something violates a rule — it violates the rule (strict interpretation)
- Read ALL skills in scope before reporting — do not stop at first finding
- Fix errors immediately, do not defer
- Do NOT update versions or dates unless user explicitly requests it
- `shared/` changes affect every skill that references them — always check reverse dependencies
- Intent review (M1-M5) evaluates DESIGN, not correctness — findings are judgment-based, not binary
- RETHINK findings are advisory — explain WHY, author decides WHETHER to act
- REVERT findings are executed immediately — changes without concrete defect are rolled back, listed in Fixed table
- SPECULATIVE items (M5) without user response default to REVERT — no silent acceptance of model-generated additions
